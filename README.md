ABACUS &amp; phonopy calculation

## Prerequisite
Following packages needs to be installed first:
- [ABACUS](https://github.com/abacusmodeling/abacus-develop/releases)
- [Phonopy](https://phonopy.github.io/phonopy/index.html)

## Installation
1. Move 'abacus.py' to '~/phonopy/interface'
2. Add ABACUS-related codes in the '~/phonopy/interface/calculator.py' as 'calculator.py' we provided, which corresponds to Phonopy v2.13.1. Thus, I recommend that one should not overlap it directly so as not to cause a version mismatch

## Usage
1. Prepare a 'setting.conf' with following tags:
```
DIM = 2 2 3         
ATOM_NAME = C N     
```
- when three integers are specified after `DIM =`, a supercell elongated along axes of unit cell is created
- chemical symbols are specified after `ATOM_NAME =`, number of symbols should match `ntype` in ABACUS INPUT file
2. To obtain supercells ($2\times 2\times 3$) with displacements, run phonopy:
```
phonopy setting.conf --abacus -d
```
3. Calculate forces on atoms in the supercells with displacements. For each SCF calculation, you should specify `stru_file` with `STRU-{number}` and `cal_force=1` in INPUT in order to calculate force using ABACUS. Be careful not to relax the structures
4. Then create 'FORCE_SETS' file using ABACUS inteface:
```
phonopy -f ./disp-{number}/OUT*/running*.log
```
